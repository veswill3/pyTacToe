# pyTacToe

Learning python by writing a simple tic tac toe game.
Exploring neural networks (and dabbling in genetic algorithms) for some added fun.

## To run

```sh
$ python pyTacToe.py
```

## Dependencies
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

## TODO

 - [x] Ask what who each player is before starting game (human or various AIs)
 - [x] Add AI (moves at random)
 - [x] Add machine learning AI (neural network trained via genetic algorithm)
 - [x] Add save and load functionality
 - [ ] Tweak ML algorithm so that it actually converges

## Acknowledgements
 - I read [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) for a quick and basic understanding of Neural networks and I even reused some code from the associated git repo for my neural net implementation
